ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Finn! I'm a passionate coder skilled in Lua, Typescript, Javascript, and VueJS. As the project leader for lualock and viteeye, I've contributed to creating a safer and more efficient environment for the FiveM platform. When I'm not coding, you can find me perfecting my backstroke or honing my table tennis skills. Excited to learn, grow, and contribute to the tech world. Let's code something amazing together!
